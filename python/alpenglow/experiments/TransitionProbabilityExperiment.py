class TransitionProbabilityExperiment(prs.OnlineExperiment):
    """TransitionProbabilityExperiment(mode="normal")

    A simple algorithm that focuses on the sequence of items a user has visited is one that records how often users visited item i after visiting another item j. This can be viewed as particular form of the item-to-item nearest neighbor with a time decay function that is non-zero only for the immediately preceding item. While the algorithm is more simplistic, it is fast to update the transition fre- quencies after each interaction, thus all recent information is taken into account.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode : string
        The direction of transitions to be considered, possible values: normal, inverted, symmetric.
